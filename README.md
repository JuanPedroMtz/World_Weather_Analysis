# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

In this challenge, we have to combine the use of API's and our knowledge in pandas to get an itenerary for the our clients, depending on their preferences of weather. 
First, we look for random cities, and we obtained the weather information of each one of them. Then we asked out clients what weather do they like for their vacations. Then we looked for the cities with a similar weather, and we found an hotel in each city. Finally we create a route for them, which they will be able to enjoy.
